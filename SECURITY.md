## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/naurium/icarus-mount-editor/security/advisories/new) to report privately
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

This is a personal project provided as-is. I'll do my best to address security issues, but can't commit to specific response timelines.

- The Python API (`mount_editor.py`)
